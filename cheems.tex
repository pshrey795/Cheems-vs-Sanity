\begin{abstract}
    Nowadays, memes are very popular throughout the Internet. They are used to express feelings, like happiness, anger, or sadness. They have become one of the most dominant forms of communication in the digital age and possibly the most favourite pastime of the younger generation. The beauty of a meme is that it is not just a picture, but a story. The story is the main content of the meme, and the story is the main reason for the popularity of the meme. And another feature of memes, that results from the larger context of the memes,  is that more often than not, they are interpreted differently by different people. Due to this, sometimes, even a single meme, which is nothing more than a piece of image or text, becomes a recurrent topic of discussion, as evident from the thousands of comments following some of the more popular memes on Reddit or Instagram.

    Following this reasoning, we will try and analyze the effect memes have on language. We use the meme language \textbf{Cheems} for our case study. We intend to delve deep in the origin, history, and usage of the language and also try to understand the usage of the language in the context of the memes. We will also discuss the evolution of the language among the community using various conversational examples and try to put forth various opinions of different language groups on the validity of the language.

    The above discussion is significant because it reflects on the development of languages in short term, and highlights the importance of digital media in this day and age and the impact it has shown on our community as a whole. We will try to show that the technology of today has played a pivotal role in truly turning the world into a global village, and we spec

\section{Theoretical Framework}
Normally, a particular language develops and evolves over hundreds and possibly thousands of years, for it to seep through a wide and diverse range of language communities. Most of the traditional languages like Hindi, Gujarati, English, etc. have been spread and passed upon, more or less through direct human communication and have been used in the past for a long time.  The prevalence which these languages have achieved is primarily because it has been passed and propogated through a variety of media like human speech and interaction, writing in the form of print media. But note that the biggest hindrance to the rapid spread of these languages is the sense of locality. The geographical barriers have caused the language spread to be abysmally slow and gradual.

\subsection{Origin and Etymology of Cheems}
Before \textbf{Cheems} became famous, a certain set of memes called \textbf{doge memes} rose to prominence. The word \textbf{doge} is a misspelling of the word \textit{dog}. One of the initial versions of the meme is:

    \caption{Original Doge Meme}
\end{figure}

As can be clearly seen from the meme, even though the language is still English, the way the phrases are structured gives it a very different feeling. Additionally, the phrases are terse and they don't follow the regular English grammar. In a way, the words use their root form instead of using the contextual morphemes. Another example of a meme of this category is:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/doge_2.jpg}
    \caption{Another example of the \textit{doge meme}}
\end{figure}

Again as we can see, the meme aims to convey a story without using too many words and it has the \textit{doge} flavour of English. The story being narrated is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dog is requesting its master to not do something
    \item We then find out that the dog is requesting the master to trim its nails the next day
    \item The dog conveys that it is scared
    \item They also wonder why the master has decided to trim their nails
    \item They conclude that the master is trimming their nails because they scratched someone and hence promise that they will never scratch again
    \item The meme then ends with the dog requesting again
\end{itemize}
